<h3 align="center" style="color: maroon;font-size:20px">What is TestCode </h3>


<p style="color:#fff;font-size::18px">TestCode is an online platform that helps students and working proefessional
to fine tune their code with help of the static analysis tools like Clang Static Analyzer tools.</p><br>
<br>
<p style="color:#fff;font-size::18px">This tool can can scan the code and publish the coding errors,warning messages and compilation errors
and translate into the report which can be viewed in the report.This is by large can help students who
are doing projects and assignments in their curriculum.</p>


<h3 align="center" style="color:maroon;font-size:20px">TestCode Today</h3>



<p style="color:#fff;font-size::18px">We are students of Weltec has implemented the Static Analyzer functionality into the 
Web Interface to ease the code verification process and publish a report so that they programatic/syntax errors sighted easily and user can make neccessary
changes to run the program is righteous way.</p><br>

<p style="color:#fff;font-size::18px">We made simple design process so that everyone can easily understand and upload the file with their code.
This Website is  mainly supported to the students to enchance their coding ability.</p>



<h3 align="center" style="color:maroon;font-size:20px">Who we are.....</h3>
<br>

<p style="color:#fff;font-size::18px">We Offer Services to the users to create an awareness of Static Analysis tools
and their importance.As per the research what we have done till date most of the users 
does not have an idea about the Static Analysis tools and functionality.These tools are not 
just pertained towards the C or C++,their variety range of tools like this available in the
market.But lot of young engineer/developers wants to improve their coding abilities and maintain
the quality of the code these Analyzer can help them in a big way.So this is an attempt to 
promote these tools especially in the academic section.</p><br>

<br>
<p style="color:#fff;font-size::18px">When our client John Gould gave the requirement to us on the idea of promoting the these tools and making an application 
on it and that where we as an team started research on it and finally transformed into  the application by integrating this 
on to the WebInterface.This version of application will support the C and C ++ files,wherein user can access our application
and upload the C or C++ files and get a report the all errors and warning.</p>
